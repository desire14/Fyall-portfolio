## Welcome to my Portfolio
My name is Dasaray Fyall and I am an experienced Administrative Professional with a demonstrated history of working in the public sector seeking to transition into software development. Throughout my career, I have gained a diverse range of skills that can be transferred into the IT sector. Also, I am currently enrolled into Generation USA Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp.
